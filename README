identisaurus
============
Identisaurus is a plugin for the gcc compiler which automatically inserts a
version string into the object files being compiled.  A POSIX timestamp and a
monotonically increasing value (which is updated per build of the object file)
is added to the resulting binary/object file.  The '.rodata' section of the
binary contains this string and can be viewed by using `objdump' or `strings' or
just looking for strings inside the binary with a text editor.  Also, an
accompanying script `check_version.sh' can be used to find the version of a
specific object file that has been stamped by the identisaurus.

The identisaurus works by managing a file that keeps track of the number of
times an object file has been built.  This file is then used to update the
build count of the binary.  The user does not even need to be concerned about
this file, but if you really really are, it is called '.identisaurus.rawr,'
and lives in the directory where the source file resides.

The identisaurus does not care what language the source file was written in.
If gcc can handle it, identisaurus can too... rawr!


Building the Plugin
-------------------
Simply run `make' in the top-level directory.  The resulting file,
'identisaurus.so,' is the plugin.


Usage
-----
Simply add the plugin argument to your build scripts, makefiles, or command line
when building an object/executable:
    gcc <myfile> <options> -fplugin=identisaurus.so

If gcc complains about not being able to find the plugin, specify the path to
the plugin.  Also, plugins are only supported on gcc versions 4.5 or greater.

This plugin works by adding a global variable to the object file, which is a
string and can be referenced using the identifier in your code: '__identisaurus'
For instance, a C program can refrence this as shown below:
     #include <stdio.h>
     extern const char *__identisaurus;
     int main(void) { 
         printf("%s\n", __identisaurus);
         return 0;
     }


Notes: '.rawr' File
-------------------
Rawr, pronounced *rawr!!!* is the filename that the identisaurus emits.  It is a
'hidden' file named '.identisaurus.rawr.'  This is a very simple file and
consists of comments prefixed with a '#' character.  The comments are not (yet)
preserved between multiple builds using the identisaurus.  Therefore, you should
not waste any time adding comments.  Each line in a rawr file is a comma
separated value of:
    <object_file_name>, <build_count>
Where the 'build_count' is an integer value depicting the number of times
that the object file named 'object_file_name' has been built with gcc using
the identisaurus.  All of the stamped files in a directory are referenced by a
single .rawr file.

There is one key limitation, and that the plugin does not actually know what the
resulting .o file or binary name will be.  The file name used in the string
output by the identisaurus and in the rawr file is the name of the source file
with its extension removed.  If the source file has multiple '.' characters in
it, only the last one is considered the extension.

Users can modify the rawr file if they wish.  This can be useful if the user
wants to increase (or decrease) the build count for a particular object
file.  Note that if the user does break chronological order and decreases the
build count, that is totally fine; identisaurus does not care.  This file
gets updated every build using the identisaurus plugin.  

NOTE: Currently comments in the .rawr file are not preserved between
updates/builds using the identisaurus.

There once was an ancient beast, whose role was classifying object files, it
was only known as an identisaurus.  His (a gender neutral pronoun) bones have
never been found, but his legacy lives in all object files, like fossils from a
bygone era... *Rawr!*
